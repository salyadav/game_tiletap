Basic Layout: 

-- Select a grid size between 8 to 20.
-- Start Game
-- Game grid and score appears

-- Option to -
    -- Go back and reset the grid size
    -- Restart the same game/same size

Agenda: 

-- Click on the colores/highlighted grid before it disappears. 
-- With each click, your score increases by one.
-- If you miss more than 3 highlights, game ends.

Nature of the game:

-- First 10 clicks highlight changes every 1 sec.
-- Next 10 clicks highlight changes every 0.5sec.
-- Then 0.25 sec... 0.1sec?? (Yet to decide how far to go)

-- Optional enhancement - the highlight starts from a small pixel and zooms out to fill the box. If Clicked before 50% -> 2 points; after -> 1 point.

Important concepts: 
-- Grid layout
-- JS settimeout
-- CSS animation
-- @media to adjust sizing in smaller browser
